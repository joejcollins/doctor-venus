# Basic Principles of Mechanics

Physics begins with motion.

## Newtonâ€™s Laws

1. **Law of Inertia**: An object in motion stays in motion unless acted on by a force.
2. **F = ma**: Force equals mass times acceleration.
3. **Action and Reaction**: For every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction.
